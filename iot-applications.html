<h3>Activity 1</h3>
<p>
in this particular activity i have understood about basics of iot application, with some examples and the main features required.
so basically iot is a prebuilt software service which provides users an interface to control and record data.
it requires sensing, connectivity, user interface and integrating. this technology is used in google smart home, IP security camera 
fitness tracking  applications. 
</p>  
  

<h4> Activity 2</h4>
<p>
this activity includes smart building which includes its scenarios and main features required. devices which are equipped with positioning
 and communication trechnologies which is integrated into communication network. it requires basic learning of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data sensing through sensors
cloud computing and storage. it is used in automatic doors with motion sensors, face recognition attendence system, motion sensing escalators, voice controlled appliances and fire security alarms.
</p>

<h5>Activity 3</h5>
<p>
in this particular task we have combined first and second activities to design smart patient monitoring system for hospitals.
 the basic control interface includes high level features, parts required and users. features include graphical user interface, 
 bi directional processes information and security policies. parts needed in the hospital are heartbeat sensor, body temperature sensor,
  room temperature sensor, oximeter, blood pressure sensor. the basic users are doctors who will analyze patients situatiins, attendes,
   hospital staff and patients
